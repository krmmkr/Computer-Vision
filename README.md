# Computer-Vision

Car Classification:
   used ResNet-152 trained on Imagenet, using two branches of convolution only layers for Multiple classification. 
   Used Multiple Loss Functions for Multi-Output Classification Car brand [6 classes] and Car type [5 classes]
 
Histopathologic Cancer Detection:
  A LeNet based custom architecture with convolution only layers.

Region Proposal Network is a work in progress project. 
  My attempt to implement the region proposal network part of Faster RCNN from scratch using PyTorch with VGG16 as base network.
